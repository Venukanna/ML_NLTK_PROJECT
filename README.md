1. Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is
something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a
similarly good solution).



2. Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
○ V' is a vector space
○ every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of
the following is a subspace of V?
● The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
● The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
● The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
● The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b
